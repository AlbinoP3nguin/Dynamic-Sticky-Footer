Dynamically Sized Sticky Footer
===============================
Enough is enough with the whole nonsense that a nice looking sticky footer can only work when the height is manually specified and you have to play around with margins and stuff.
This is a sticky footer that sinks to the bottom of the webpage even if the content doesn't fill the page. It is **dynamically sized**. You do not need to manually enter the footer size.

Quick start
-----------
Check out the files. All the instructions are well explained in each file (especially the .css files).

There are working examples of different features as well as a boilerplate that you can use as a base for your website.
